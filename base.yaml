# GRS is designed after Valve's response system used in the Source engine, and is described in
# their GDC talk "Rule Databases for Contextual Dialog and Game Logic"
# For full docs you should view the plugin repo, but there's a quick rundown in the intro.
#
# to convert this file to json the game engine can load, run this command:
#   yq -o json . base.yaml > base.grs-json

# == BASICS ==
# GRS is a fuzzy rule matching system, comparing facts to select which response is most
# specific and valid currently.
#
# 1. Something happens in game engine (e.g. 'actor is hit', 'actor checks for an idle bark').
# 2. Affected actor sends a query (concept + set of facts) to GRS.
# 3. GRS checks all the rules it has loaded against the facts in the query, as well as any
#    other fact dictionaries that apply (for the world, actor, etc).
# 4. Based on the comparison, GRS matches the most specific rule. GRS selects a response
#    from the response group that rule points to.
# 5. The actor emits a signal with the response!
# 6. (optionally) GRS makes more queries based on 'then' rules.

# == CONCEPT ==
# - type: concept
#   name: 
#   description: 
#   priority: 0
#
# Why the system is being queried. These are events the programmers need to send to GRS for it
# to work, e.g. 'IdleBark' (actor is idle), 'GotHit' (actor just got hit by something).
# 
# Concepts default to a priority of `0`. Concepts with a higher priority (`1`, `2`, `3`, etc)
# will interrupt concepts with a lower priority (for example, to let a death noise interrupt
# normal dialogue). If `nopriority` is given as a concept's priority, that concept will never
# interrupt any other speech and the system will act as though no event is happening when
# other responses check for activity.

# == CRITERIA ==
# - type: criteria
#   name: 
#   fact: 
#   match: ''
#
# Named true/false check, used to create rules. For example, the criterion `PlayerNearby` may
# be true if `playerDistance<300`. Criteria can be calculated once and then used by multiple
# rules, which helps with performance.
#
# 'fact' is the name of a fact to compare against, and 'match' is the value to match against
# that fact. For example, 'playerDistance' and '<300' would match if the player is close.
#
# Match values can be prefixed with ! or != to invert them, and can use this syntax:
# - '"hurt"' = true if the fact is the string "hurt".
# - '<30' = true if the fact is a number under 30.
# - '>=10' = true if the fact is a number ten or above.
#
# Default facts:
# - concept: The concept that initiated this query.
# - randomnum: Random float from 0 to 100, calculated once before the query.

# == RULE ==
# - type: rule
#   name: 
#   criteria: 
#   responses: 
#   flags: 
#   applyactorcontext: 
#   applyworldcontext: 
#
# Set of one or more criteria to match, and one or more response groups to trigger. The 'rule
# database' is what GRS compares incoming queries against.
#
# The criteria and responses list is separated by spaces, e.g. "IsSarah KatieNearby".
#
# For simplicity, try to start a rule's name off with the entity it's evaluated on. For
# example, a rule checking whether a character named Em is idle should be named "EmIdle".

# == RESPONSES ==
# - type: responsegroup
#   name: 
#   flags: 
#   responses:
#     - responsetype: 
#       response: 
#       flags: 
#       then: <actor|all> <concept>
#       busyfor: 4.0
#
# How actors respond once a rule is matched. These include the lines of text to say, actions
# to take, and more. GRS will pick one of the responses randomly from the group.
#
# When 'then' is given, GRS fires this new criteria on the given actor once the busy time has
# passed. 'any' to test every nearby actor, and GRS will stop once an actor does a response.
# See https://youtu.be/tAbBID3N64A?t=3341 for details.
#
# Response types:
# - say: Say a line of text
# - animation: Play the given animation
